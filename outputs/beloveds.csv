My Immortal with Commentary,Chapter 3.,VioletKingston,878,42,140,"AN: STOP FLAMMING DA STORY PREPZ OK! odderwize fangs 2 da goffik ppl 4 da good reveiws! FANGS AGEN RAVEN! oh yeah, BTW I don't own dis or da lyrics 4 Good Chralotte.The author got good reviews? Hopefully those goffs only gave her good reviews because they wanted to continue laughing because of this terrible fanfic... Otherwise, I think I don't have any faith left in humanity...XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXOn the night of the concert I put on my black lace-up boots with high heels. Underneath them were ripped red fishnets. Then I put on a black leather minidress with all this corset stuff on the back and front. I put on matching fishnet on my arms. I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky.Nobody cares about your terrible sense of fashion.I felt a little depressed then, so I slit one of my wrists.That is the worst depiction of depression I have EVER read. You're hearing this from someone who's mother is a psychologist and who spends all her days reading bad fanfics.I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding and I listened to some GC. I painted my nails black and put on TONS of black eyeliner. Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on foundation because I was pale anyway.Nobody cares about your damn makeup!I drank some human blood so I was ready to go to the concert.I went outside. Draco was waiting there in front of his flying car.It better be a Ford Anglia.He was wearing a Simple Plan t-shirt (they would play at the show too), baggy black skater pants, black nail polish and a little eyeliner (AN: A lot fo kewl boiz wer it ok!).These kids would be bullied to death on my school.""Hi Draco!"" I said in a depressed voice.Aren't depressed voices supposed to be soft? Why the exclamation point?""Hi Ebony."" he said back. We walked into his flying black Mercedes-Benz (the license plate said 666)Why. Just why. I can't.and flew to the place with the concert. On the way we listened excitedly to Good Charlotte and Marilyn Manson. We both smoked cigarettes and drugs.The author says this as if it were a normal thing to do for them. So if they smoke, where are the bad things that happen to smokers? Like coughing or puking. Or did they only start smoking, like, a week ago?When we got there, we both hopped out of the car. We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to Good Charlotte.""You come in cold, you're covered in blood They're all so happy you've arrived The doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your mom She sets you free into this life."" sang Joel (I don't own da lyrics 2 dat song).I imagine all the broken hearts of the fans of Good Charlotte at this moment.""Joel is so fucking hot."" I said to Draco, pointing to him as he sung, filling the club with his amazing voice.So there's a club in Hogsmeade now? What book did I not read?Suddenly Draco looked sad.""What's wrong?"" I asked as we moshed to the music. Then I caught on.""Hey, it's ok I don't like him better than YOU!"" I said.Oh dear... They're going to be a couple, aren't they... Why?! Why must you ruin Draco for me?!""Really?"" asked Draco sensitively and he put his arm around me all protective.""Really."" I said. ""Besides I don't even know Joel and he's going out with Hilary fucking Duff. I fucking hate that little bitch."" I said disgustedly, thinking of her ugly blonde face.Can someone's face be blonde? Does one have a brown face because they have brown hair? Or a red face if they have red hair?The night went on really well, and I had a great time. So did Draco. After the concert, we drank some beer and asked Benji and Joel for their autographs and photos with them. We got GC concert tees. Draco and I crawled back into the Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didn't go back into Hogwarts, instead he drove the car into........................... the Forbidden Forest!  No! I sense a bad sex scene! And for how long did they know each other again?"

(that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I don't even know where to begin on that last sentence. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. Stop fucking lyin'.. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England HOGWARTS IS IN SCOTLAND where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. Wow, really? I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing Nobody gives a shit. black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining Hailing or sleeting, basically. Get your ass back inside. so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.""Hey Ebony!"" shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Draco Malfoy! Why the elipse?""What's up Draco?"" I asked.""Nothing."" he said shyly.But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX No.AN: IS it good? PLZ tell me fangz!

BTW preps stop flaming ma story ok!XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet Later in the story though, Enoby claims she hates pink. with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun. In a kind of messy bun.My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.) Please stop describing clothes so damn much.""OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"" she said excitedly.""Yeah? So?"" I said, blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.""No I so fucking don't!"" I shouted. Which means you do. Come one Enoby, we read enough fics to know."
Everything Wrong With My Immortal,Chapter 7. Wake Me Up,FFSins,26,2,1,"Chapter 7. Bring me 2 life (That's an Evanescence song. As we've established before, Amy  Lee is Queen. Bring Me To Life is an amazing song. You will not desecrate her and her band's name by inserting songs as titles in your STUPID fanfic, am I understood? Also, why do all the other chapters not have titles but this one does?)AN: wel ok u guyz im only writting dis cuz I got 5 god reviuws. (Really?) n BTW I wont rite da nxt chapter til I git TIN god vons! (Honestly, I'm surprised you even got 5) STO FLAMING OR ILL REPORT U! (I doubt you could report every flamer) Evony (Oh, so it's Evony now?) isn't a Marie Sue ok she isn't perfect SHES A SATANITS! (There are different types of Mary Sues you know.) n she has problemz shes depressed 4 godz sake! (Really? Why would she be depressed? She has everything going for her)XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXZXXXXXXXXXXXXXDraco and I held our pale white hands with black nail polish (I don't know where to begin) as we went upstairs. I was wearing red Satanist sings on my nails in red nail polish (But didn't you just say your nail polish is black?) (AN: c doez dat sound lik a Maru Sue 2 u? (Yes.)). I waved to Vampire. Dark misery was in his depressed eyes. (You can't say that. It's obvious he's depressed. As is every other character in this story.) I guess he was jealous of me that I was going out with Draco. Anyway, I went upstairs excitedly with Draco. We went into his room and locked the door. (Oh no...) Then............ (Oh my god. THREE!!!!!)We started frenching passively (I don't think that's possible) and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. (You kiss passively and take off clothes enthusiastically. Ok?)  He felt me up before I took of my top. Then I took off my black leather bra (OUCH!) and he took off his pants. We went on the bed and started making out naked and then he put his boy's thingy in mine and we HAD SEX. (c is dat stupid?) (Yes. Very much so.)""Oh Draco, Draco!"" I screamed while getting an orgasm when all of a sudden I saw a tattoo I had never seen before on Draco's arm. (Didn't you already have sex?) It was a black heart with an arrow through it. On it in bloody gothic writing were the words............ (Oh for god's sake.) Vampire! (Two things. One, I appreciate you putting in some Drarry but really? Also, how do you know that's about Harry? It could be about you, since, as you've stated, you too are a vampire.)I was so angry.""You bastard!"" I shouted angrily, jumping out of the bed. (See above sin)""No! No! But you don't understand!"" Draco pleaded. But I knew too much.""No, you fucking idiot!"" I shouted. ""You probably have AIDs (AIDS you idiot) anyway!""I put on my clothes all huffily(You sound like a two year old) and then stomped out. Draco ran out even though he was naked. (He couldn't have pulled on at least some pants?) He had a really big you-know-what but I was too mad to care. (So why'd you mention it?) I stomped out (You already said that.) and did so until I was in Vampire's classroom where he was having a lesson with Professor Snape (How'd you know?) and some other people.(And those other people matter just enough to get mentioned but not enough to be name checked?)""VAMPIRE POTTER, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"" I yelled. (Way to make a scene)Sin tally: 144No fanfic is without sin"
"My immortal, the commentary",Chapter 6,Monkee66,22,1,0,"Hello sweeties. How are you all doing? Here's a few more chapters for you to laugh at. Enjoy.  Chapter 6.AN: shjt up prepz ok! PS I wnot update ubtil u give me goood revows!XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe  next day I woke up in my coffin. This is not impotent to the story, we get that you sleep in a coffin I put on a black miniskirt that was  all ripped around the end and a matching top with red skulls all over it so the top is ripped or the mini has skulls over it, ether way...  and high heeled boots that were black. You could just say black high heeled boots I put on two pairs of skull  earrings, and two crosses in my ears. You would have burned if you put crosses in your ear if you're a vampire  I spray-painted my hair with  purple. Spray-painted your hair? Who spray-paints their hair? In the Great Hall, I ate some Count Chocula cereal with  blood instead of milk, Because that's the cool thing, eating cereal with blood not milk. Chocolate and blood sound like a bad combination. I've tried corn flakes with orange juice....don't do it. and a glass of red blood. Suddenly someone bumped  into me. All the blood spilled over my top.""Bastard!"" I shouted  angrily. Deep breath girl did you wake up on the wrong side of your coffin?  I regretted saying it when I looked up cause I was looking  into the pale white face of a gothic boy with spiky black hair with red  streaks in it. Okay the hair style sounds cool He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down his  face and he was wearing black lipstick. But the rest of the description sounds horrid   He didn't have glasses anymore  and now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's and there  was no scar on his forhead anymore. He had a manly stubble on his chin.  He had a sexy English accent. How do you know? He hasn't spoken yet. Unless you're generalizing, but he could be Irish and speak with an hot Irish accent. Just saying.  He looked exactly like Joel Madden. He was  so sexy that my body went all hot when I saw him kind of like an  erection only I'm a girl so I didn't get one you sicko. No comment. ""I'm so sorry."" he said in a shy voice. NOW you can comment on his accent. And if it's a shy voice, say he whispered or something. ""That's all right. What's your name?"" I questioned.""My name's Harry Potter, although most people call me Vampire these days."" he grumbled. Poor guy, I'd be grumbling to if I got that nickname. ""Why?"" I exclaimed. This little mark here ! means you exclaimed something, a ? means you questioned it. If your doing both you say something like this 'Why?!' I exclaimed.'    ""Because I love the taste of human blood."" he giggled. Harry, sorry Vampire, is messed up...why is he giggling because he likes the taste of human blood? Back away slowly and don't make eye contact.  ""Well, I am a vampire."" I confessed. Not something I'd be saying as an interdiction. ""Really?"" he whimpered. Yeah, I'd be scared to. Female vampires seduce men, but I don't think you have anything to worry about Harry, Ebnoby is a wannabe. ""Yeah."" I roared. You need a exclamation point at the end of 'yeah' so people know to yell it out. We sat down to talk for a while. What did you talk about? Then Draco came up behind me and told me he had a surprise for me so I went away with him. With out saying good by...rude. So there is chapter six. Anyone need brain bleach yet? Please leave a review if you liked it. "

""What the fuck do you think you are doing?""Please Draco, don't say sex!Draco didn't answer but he stopped the flying car and he walked out of it. I walked out of it too, curiously.""What the fucking hell?"" I asked angrily.""Ebony?"" he asked.Wait, is it Enoby or Ebony?""What?"" I snapped.Draco leaned in extra-close and I looked into his gothic red eyes (he was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly I didn't feel mad anymore.Why is Draco depressed all of a sudden?And then............... suddenly just as I Draco kissed me passionately.No, there's no passion between these two. They aren't even dating!Draco climbed on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree. He took of my top and I took of his clothes. I even took of my bra. Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time.Oh please! Stop it!""Oh! Oh! Oh! "" I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm. We started to kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm.

I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I don't even know where to begin on that last sentence. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. Stop fucking lyin'.. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England HOGWARTS IS IN SCOTLAND where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. Wow, really? I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing Nobody gives a shit. black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining Hailing or sleeting, basically. Get your ass back inside. so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.""Hey Ebony!"" shouted a voice. I looked up. It was....

I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet Later in the story though, Enoby claims she hates pink. with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun. In a kind of messy bun.My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.) Please stop describing clothes so damn much.""OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"" she said excitedly.""Yeah? So?"" I said, blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.""No I so fucking don't!"" I shouted. Which means you do.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe  next day I woke up in my bedroom. Where did you think you were going to wake up? On top of the roof? It was snowing and raining again. That is called sleet! Where you trying to make a word count or something? I  opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had.  I'm pretty sure blood has to be in the fridge if it's not going to be used right away.  My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black  lace on the ends. That screams GOTH....not. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR You should say 'My Chemical Romance' at this point in case there are people out there who don't know.    t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather  dress, I found a black leather pencil skirt once at a store. I tried it on and it was uncomfortable. How can you wear a dress made out of it? I'll stick with leather jackets.  a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. So you dressed like a hooker? I put  on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind  of messy bun.My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u! Random friend shout out time! ) woke up  then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black  hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. Back up. She grinned at you, flipped her hair, THEN opened her eyes....creepy. She put on her  Marilyn Manson Fun fact, Marilyn Manson came up with his stage name from Marilyn Monroe and 60s killer Charles Manson.   t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy  high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation  and black eyeliner.) Is the makeup you're wearing important to the story? If it's not, then don't mention it. ""OMFG, Again, spell it out for people who don't know what this stands for. I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"" she said excitedly.""Yeah? So?"" I said, blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall. By the way she wrote this it sounds like the Slytherin common room opens right into the Great Hall.""No I so fucking don't!"" I shouted. I think there should be a comma after No. Or an exclamation point. ""Yeah right!"" she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.""Hi."" he said.""Hi."" I replied flirtily. I just looked it up flirtily is a word, but how do you say 'hi' in a flirtily way? ""Guess what."" he said.""What?"" I asked.""Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade."" he told me. Why would a muggle band be playing in a all magical village? Or is Good Charlotte now a wizard band? Also, how would DRACO MALFOY know muggle bands?! ""Oh. My. Fucking. God!"" I screamed. I think Malfoy just lost his hearing. I love GC. They are my favorite band, besides MCR.""Well.... do you want to go with me?"" he asked.I gasped. There we go chapter two done. Only nine hundred and ninety nine thousand to go. "

I had boots like that once, they were combat boots...they were my sisters but she gave them to me, I loved them, mom did not though. Underneath them were ripped red fishnets. Why are you wearing ripped fishnets? Then I put on a black  leather minidress with all this corset stuff Does she mean lace? Now I have Stevie Nicks and Don Henley's song 'Leather and lace' going through my head. I like that song. on the back and front. I  put on matching fishnet on my arms. No, you ether put matching fishnets on you arms or you put matching fishnets on. I straightened my hair and made it  look all spiky. Okay, I'll let her have this one...maybe she was trying different styles? Or maybe not because how do you make long hair look spiky? Did she get a hair cut? I felt a little depressed then, so I slit one of my  wrists. Don't cut yourself! It's very bad! I read a depressing book while I waited for it to stop bleeding But, you're a vampire....you don't bleed, unless you have prophyria  and I listened to some GC. I painted my nails black and put on TONS of  black eyeliner. Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on  foundation because I was pale anyway. I drank some human blood Yummy so I was  ready to go to the concert.I went outside. Draco was waiting  there in front of his flying car. I didn't know Draco had a flying car...when did he get that? He was wearing a Simple Plan t-shirt  (they would play at the show too), You don't need parentheses AND commas baggy black skater pants, black nail  polish and a little eyeliner (AN: A lot fo kewl boiz wer it ok!). Name one cool guy who where it. ""Hi Draco!"" I said in a depressed voice. I greeted him sadly would be better.""Hi  Ebony."" he said back. We walked into his flying black Mercedes-Benz were you not paying attention to where you where going or what?    (the license plate said 666) I'd like mine to say KAZ-2Y5 and flew to the place with the concert. On  the way we listened excitedly to Good Charlotte and Marilyn Manson. We  both smoked cigarettes and drugs. When we got there, we both hopped out  of the car. We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped  up and down as we listened to Good Charlotte.""You come in cold, you're covered in bloodThey're all so happy you've arrivedThe doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your momShe sets you free into this life."" sang Joel (I don't own da lyrics 2 dat song).""Joel is so fucking hot."" I said to Draco, pointing to him as he sung, filling the club with his amazing voice. That sentence makes it sound like Draco was singing.Suddenly Draco looked sad. My father will hear about this.  ""What's wrong?"" I asked as we moshed to the music.  Well lets see...you're talking about how hot a singer is ON A DATE WITH A GUY YOU HAVE HAD A CRUSH ON!!!! Then I caught on.""Hey, it's ok I don't like him better than YOU!"" I said.""Really?"" asked Draco sensitively Draco is not sensitive....he gave Katie Bell a cursed necklace and he put his arm around me all protective.""Really.""  I said. ""Besides I don't even know Joel and he's going out with Hilary  fucking Duff. I fucking hate that little bitch."" WOW, there are actors I hate but I don't call them bitches. Jezz, what did Hilary Duff do to you....steal Joel from you? Oh, you never had him! I said disgustedly,  thinking of her ugly blonde face. The night went on really well,  and I had a great time. So did Draco. After the concert, we drank some  beer Underage drinking, and wizards don't have beer, they have fire whisky. and asked Benji and Joel for their autographs and photos with them.  We got GC concert tees. Draco and I crawled Crawled? You must've been hammered. back into the  Mercedes-Benz, but Draco didn't go back into Hogwarts, instead he drove  the car into........................... the Forbidden Forest! That's why you don't drink and drive!! So, what do you think so far? I'm trying to be funny with this but I don't know...am I? Please leave a comment and tell me what you think. "

I put on a black miniskirt that was all ripped around the end and a matching top with red skulls all over it and high heeled boots that were black. I put on two pairs of skull earrings, and two crosses in my ears. But crosses can kill vampires, Enoby. I spray-painted my hair with purple.In the Great Hall, I ate some Count Chocula cereal with blood instead of milk How the fuck do you get away with that?, and a glass of red blood. Suddenly someone bumped into me. All the blood spilled over my top.""Bastard!"" I shouted angrily. I regretted saying it when I looked up cause I was looking into the pale white face of a gothic boy with spiky black hair with red streaks in it. He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down his face and he was wearing black lipstick. He didn't have glasses anymore and now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco's and there was no scar on his forhead anymore. Scars don't disappear completely. He had a manly stubble on his chin. He had a sexy English accent. He looked exactly like Joel Madden. He was so sexy that my body went all hot when I saw him kind of like an erection only I'm a girl so I didn't get one you sicko. Why do you word this so poorly?""I'm so sorry."" he said in a shy voice.""That's all right. What's your name?"" I questioned.""My name's Harry Potter, although most people call me Vampire these days."" he grumbled. Angsty teen trope much?""Why?"" I exclaimed. That shouldn't even be a question. People call him Vampire cause he's a fucking vampire.""Because I love the taste of human blood."" he giggled. What's funny about that?""Well, I am a vampire."" I confessed.""Really?"" he whimpered.""Yeah."" I roared. I just imagined that lion that appears before really old Warner Bros. cartoons because of the way you used 'roared'.We sat down to talk for a while. Then Draco came up behind me and told me he had a surprise for me so I went away with him. Us fanfic readers know where this is going.Chapter 7.

I was wearing red Satanist sings on my nails in red nail polish (AN: c doez dat sound lik a Maru Sue 2 u? Not all Mary Sues are 'preps'.). I waved to Vampire. Dark misery was in his depressed eyes. Trying too hard. I guess he was jealous of me that I was going out with Draco. Anyway, I went upstairs excitedly with Draco. We went into his room and locked the door. Then............ Oh God no.We started frenching passively So neither of you are reacting. and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. He felt me up before I took of my top. Then I took off my black leather bra and he took off his pants. We went on the bed and started making out naked and then he put his boy's thingy in mine and we HAD SEX. (c is dat stupid?

Good job Draco, you're only the 1,000th person to be able to do that! *giggles* God this is fun!) Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time. (*clap. Clap. Clap.* best description of sex ever. Also, I might believe that Draco's a virgin, but not Ebony.)""Oh! Oh! Oh! "" I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm. (In two seconds?) We started to kiss everywhere (really? Ebony is actually a contortionist! I was right!) and my pale (not orange, pale. She's a pale, Satanist Trump.

You are telling me that you are walking OUTSIDE in a miniskirt and corset whilst it's snowing! Go inside you bloody idiot.A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.What a savage""Hey Ebony!"" shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Draco Malfoy!""What's up Draco?"" I asked.Didn't you just flip him and his group off?""Nothing."" he said shyly.Pretty sure Draco is a cocky little shit and never showed the slightest hint of shyness around anyone in Hogwarts. So i guess it's just you Mary SueBut then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.AN: IS it good? PLZ tell me fangz!Kill meChapter 2.AN: Fangz 2 bloodytearz666 4 helpin me wif da chapta! BTW preps stop flaming ma story ok!Are you writing in your accent?The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had.I'm 110% sure that Dumbledore wouldn't be okay with you having a damn coffin. Vampires are considered bad beings in the wizzarding world so I'm guessing that like with Lupin (who is the fucking bomb) you would be treated as if you were a regular witch. That means sleeping on a bed.My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)I would like to say that neither MCR or Marilyn Manson would exist in the Wizarding world. They're Muggles.""OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"" she said excitedly.OMFG I like totes saw you tlking to that hottie DracoPlease tell me this text talk won't be a regular thing""Yeah? So?"" I said, blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.Of course you're a Slytherine""No I so fucking don't!"" I shouted.I'm calling BS""Yeah right!"" she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.""Hi."" he said.""Hi."" I replied flirtily.Why are you flirting??""Guess what."" he said.""What?"" I asked.""Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade."" he told me.Good Charlotte is a Muggle band... you don't care? Nevermind then""Oh. My. Fucking. God!"" I screamed. I love GC. They are my favorite band, besides MCR.""Well.... do you want to go with me?"" he asked.I gasped.A shocking turn of affairs obviouslyApparently that's a cliff hanger"
My Immortal Commentary (Bit late I know),10-12 (3 instead of 2 yay),FrankieEllor7,8,1,0,"Chapter 10.AN: stup it u gay fags if u donot lik ma story den fukk off! ps it turnz out b'loody mary isn't a muggle afert al n she n vampire r evil datz y dey movd houses ok!Oh what do you know! That's a coincidence.I was really scared about Vlodemort all day. I was even upset went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Bloody Gothic Rose 666.Oh edgy band name to go with my edgy self and edgy car.I am the lead singer of it and I play guitar. People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR. The other people in the band are B'loody Mary, Vampire, Draco, Ron (although we call him Diabolo now. He has black hair now with blue streaks in it.) and Hargrid. Ron Weasly is now called Diablo and is in a band called Bloody Gothic Rose 666... I'm done.Only today Draco and Vampire were depressed so they weren't coming and we wrote songs instead. I knew Draco was probably slitting his wrists (he wouldn't die because he was a vampire too and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there's no way I'm writing that) or a steak)1)Since when did Draco become a vampire?2) Grow up3)How does a steak (meat) kill vampires?Vampire was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride. I put on a black leather shirt that showed off my boobs and tiny matching miniskirt that said Simple Plan on the butt. You might think I'm a slut but I'm really not.Ahhh yes, Corpse Bride the most depressing movie ever.We were singing a cover of 'Helena' and at the end of the song I suddenly bust into tears.Edgy turned up to 1000""Ebony! Are you OK?"" B'loody Mary asked in a concerted voice.""What the fuck do you think?"" I asked angrily. And then I said. ""Well, Voldemort came and the fucking bastard told me to fucking kill Harry! But I don't want to kill him, because, he's really nice, even if he did go out with Draco. But if I don't kill Harry, then Voldemort, will fucking kill Draco!"" I burst into tears.That was an awful lot of F-words.Suddenly Draco jumped out from behind a wall.Draco outta nowhere""Why didn't you fucking tell me!"" he shouted. ""How could you- you- you fucking poser muggle bitch!"" (c is dat out of character?)Nope, not at allI started to cry and cry. Draco started to cry too all sensitive. Then he ran out crying.I'm confusedWe practiced for one more hour. Then suddenly Dumbeldore walked in angrily! His eyes were all fiery and I knew this time it wasn't cause he had a headache.Angry Dumbeldore""What have you done!"" He started to cry wisely. (c dats basically nut swering and dis time he wuz relly upset n u wil c y) ""Ebony Draco has been found in his room. He committed suicide by slitting his wrists.""1) How does one cry wisely2) You just said Draco couldn't die from anything but crosses and stakesChapter 11.AN: i sed stup flaming up prepz! c if dis chaptr is srupid!1111 it delz wit rly sris issus! sp c 4 urself if itz ztupid brw fangz 2 ma frend raven 4 hleping me!"

I was wearing red Satanist sings on my nails in red nail polish (AN: c doez dat sound lik a Maru Sue 2 u?). Yes.I waved to Vampire. Dark misery was in his depressed eyes. I guess he was jealous of me that I was going out with Draco. Anyway, I went upstairs excitedly with Draco. We went into his room and locked the door. Then............No. No. Noooooo!!!We started frenching passivelyBonjour, mon amie! J'aime les croissants! That, ladies and gentlemen, is the only thing I learned after two years of French classes.and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. He felt me up before I took of my top. Then I took off my black leather braA leather bra? That must hurt a lot.and he took off his pants. We went on the bed and started making out naked and then he put his boy's thingy in mine and we HAD SEX. (c is dat stupid?)Two kids in a sandbox (Do not Google that. If your curiosity gets the best of you, don't say I didn't warn you).""Oh Draco, Draco!"" I screamed while getting an orgasm when all of a sudden I saw a tattoo I had never seen before on Draco's arm. It was a black heart with an arrow through it. On it in bloody gothic writing were the words............ Vampire!So Harry and Draco dated before this?I was so angry.""You bastard!"" I shouted angrily, jumping out of the bed.""No! No! But you don't understand!"" Draco pleaded. But I knew too much.""No, you fucking idiot!"" I shouted. ""You probably have AIDs anyway!""Dumb stereotype about homosexuals.I put on my clothes all huffily and then stomped out. Draco ran out even though he was naked. He had a really big you-know-what but I was too mad to care. I stomped out and did so until I was in Vampire's classroom where he was having a lesson with Professor Snape and some other people.""VAMPIRE POTTER, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!""

My Immortal with Commentary,Chapter 9.,VioletKingston,607,38,98,"AN: stop flaming ok! I dntn red all da boox!With all respect to the people who haven't read the books, NEVER write fanfictions if you haven't read at least some of the books. You just get a way better picture of the character's personalities and just the general world they live in after reading the books. Of course, you can know enough from the movies for the storyline, but it's the small things, like Harry's eye color being different, that just annoy the heck out of me.dis is frum da movie ok so itz nut my folt if dumbeldor swers! besuizds I SED HE HAD A HEDACHE! and da reson snap dosent lik harry now is coz hes christian and vampire is a satanist! MCR ROX!Totally unrelated band reference at the end. And we all know the tale of Dumbledore's headache. And it's ridiculous. A character having a headache isn't an excuse for them to magically have a different personality.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX666XXXXXXXXXXXI was so mad and sad. I couldn't believe Draco for cheating on me. I began to cry against the tree where I did it with Draco.Newsflash: Maybe he didn't cheat on you! Maybe he just dated Vampire/Harry before you two started dating. Also, when did you ask him to be your boyfriend again?Then all of a suddenly, an horrible man with red eyes and no nose and everything started flying towards me on a broomstick! He didn't have a nose (basically like Voldemort in the movie) and he was wearing all black but it was obvious he wasn't gothic. It was...... Voldemort!No shit Sherlock! Also, people call him He Who Must Not Be Named.""No!"" I shouted in a scared voice but then Voldemort shouted ""Imperius!"" and I couldn't run away.""Crookshanks!"" I shouted at him. Voldemort fell of his broom and started to scream. I felt bad for him even though I'm a sadist so I stopped.It's flippin' Voldemort. You don't leave Voldemort laying around, because he will kill you. And cats are not spells.""Ebony."" he yelled. ""Thou must kill Vampire Potter!""Why is he speaking Shakespearian? Is it called that? And out of everyone, he chose Ebony to kill him. He could do it himself.I thought about Vampire and his sexah eyes and his gothic black hair and how his face looks just like Joel Madden.Who's cheating here?!I remembered that Draco had said I didn't understand, so I thought, what if Draco went out with Vampire before I went out with him and they broke up?Wow, great thinking!""No, Voldemort!"" I shouted back.Voldemort gave me a gun. ""No! Please!"" I begged.A gun. A. Gun. Wow.""Thou must!"" he yelled. ""If thou does not, then I shall kill thy beloved Draco!""So you can't kill Harry, but you can kill Draco?""How did you know?"" I asked in a surprised way.Voldemort got a dude-ur-so-retarded look on his face.That look has been on my face this entire time.""I hath telekinesis."" he answered cruelly. ""And if you doth not kill Vampire, then thou know what will happen to Draco!"" he shouted. Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.This is starting to be funny, somehow.I was so scared and mad I didn't know what to do.Kill both of them! Kill the OOC Harry and Draco!Suddenly Draco came into the woods.""Draco!"" I said. ""Hi!""""Hi."" he said back but his face was all sad. He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner kind of like a pentagram (geddit) between Joel Madden and Gerard Way. ""Are you okay?"" I asked.""No."" he answered.""I'm sorry I got all mad at you but I thought you cheated on me."" I expelled.""That's okay."" he said all depressed and we went back into Hogwarts together making out.And here I was, thinking they were only in it for the sex. Oh wait..."

Draco screamed sadly.My friend B'loody Mary Smith smiled at me understatedly. She flipped her long waste-length gothic black hair and opened her crimson eyes like blood that she was wearing contact lenses on. She had pale white skin that she was wearing white makeup on. Hermione was kidnapped when she was born. Her real parents are vampires and one of them is a witch but Voldemort killed her mother and her father committed suicide because he was depressed about it. She still has nightmares about it and she is very haunted and depressed. It also turns out her real last name is Smith and not Granger.

What did you do? until I was in Vampire's classroom  where he was having a lesson with Professor Snape and some other people. Some other people??? Like who, his fellow classmates, strangers?

He's driving ya idjit.    Draco didn't answer but he stopped the flying car and he walked out of it. I walked out of it too, curiously. The car is hovering in mid-air, and you just walk out of it? Did you fall to the ground? If you did, then you should put that in there. ""What the fucking hell?"" I asked angrily. You don't need to put in angrily, we get that your pissed because of the swear word.""Ebony?"" he asked.""What?"" I snapped. Deep breath. All he did was say your name. I don't even know why you're mad...you just drove into the forest, I mean, yeah it's against school rules, but you already broke two of them by going to a MCR concert at night and violating the schools dress code. Just saying....braking a few more won't hurt.   Draco  leaned in extra-close Creepy.   and I looked into his gothic red eyes (he was  wearing color contacts)  which revealed so much depressing sorrow and  evilness Depressing sorrow and evilness? and then suddenly I didn't feel mad anymore.And  then............... suddenly just as I Draco kissed me passionately. This is when I'd punch him and go running up to the school yelling.   Draco climbed  on top of me and we started to make out keenly against a tree. Climbing on top of someone suggests that they're laying down. Poor tree.  He took  of my top and I took of his clothes. I even took of my bra. Then he put  his thingie Penis into my you-know-what Vagina and we did it Had sex for the first time. If you can't write a decent sex scene, then maybe you shouldn't be putting them in? Or practice writing them first. Just a suggestion. ""Oh!  Oh! Oh! "" I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm How can she spell orgasm right but not her main character?. We started to  kiss everywhere and my pale body became all warm Again, because your a vampire, you have no blood, there for YOUR BODY CAN NOT BECOME WARM!!!! . And then....""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING YOU MOTHERFUKERS!"" Way to spoil the mood. It was.............................................................Dumbledore! But- Dumbledore doesn't swear...So, what did you think? Anything I can change or add more of? Please let me know. Thank you. "

Underneath them were ripped red fishnets. Then I put on a black leather minidress with all this corset stuff on the back and front. I put on matching fishnet on my arms. I straightened my hair and made it look all spiky.

I painted my nails black and put on TONS of black eyeliner. Then I put on some black lipstick. I didn't put on foundation because I was pale anyway. I drank some human blood so I was ready to go to the concert.WhyyyyyyyI went outside. Draco was waiting there in front of his flying car. He was wearing a Simple Plan t-shirt (they would play at the show too), baggy black skater pants, black nail polish and a little eyeliner (AN: A lot fo kewl boiz wer it ok!).Draco Malfoy, a pure blood wizard knows of Simple Plan and wears guy liner... His father will hear about this.Kool Boiz LOL""Hi Draco!"" I said in a depressed voice.""Hi Ebony."" he said back. We walked into his flying black Mercedes-Benz (the license plate said 666) and flew to the place with the concert. Oh my God so edgy with your 666 number plate.Also Draco wouldn't have a flying carOn the way we listened excitedly to Good Charlotte and Marilyn Manson. We both smoked cigarettes and drugs. UghWhen we got there, we both hopped out of the car. We went to the mosh pit at the front of the stage and jumped up and down as we listened to Good Charlotte.WIZARD MOSH PIT""You come in cold, you're covered in bloodThey're all so happy you've arrivedThe doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your momShe sets you free into this life."" sang Joel (I don't own da lyrics 2 dat song).We know you don't own the lyrics...they're spelt correctly""Joel is so fucking hot."" I said to Draco, pointing to him as he sung, filling the club with his amazing voice.Suddenly Draco looked sad.""What's wrong?"" I asked as we moshed to the music. Then I caught on.""Hey, it's ok I don't like him better than YOU!"" I said.But you told your mate Willow you didn't like him!!""Really?"" asked Draco sensitively and he put his arm around me all protective.""Really."" I said. ""Besides I don't even know Joel and he's going out with Hilary fucking Duff. I fucking hate that little bitch."" I said disgustedly, thinking of her ugly blonde face.Ebony isn't a Lizzie Mcguire fan thenThe night went on really well, and I had a great time. So did Draco. After the concert, we drank some beer and asked Benji and Joel for their autographs and photos with them. We got GC concert tees.

Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way -_-Not to sure about the hair choicesI'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie.Incest?I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen).I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black.She's a goth. A gothic vampire witch...fuck offI love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. You are telling me that you are walking OUTSIDE in a miniskirt and corset whilst it's snowing! Go inside you bloody idiot.A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.What a savage""Hey Ebony!"" shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Draco Malfoy!""What's up Draco?"" I asked.Didn't you just flip him and his group off?""Nothing."" he said shyly.Pretty sure Draco is a cocky little shit and never showed the slightest hint of shyness around anyone in Hogwarts.

I opened the door of my coffin and drank some blood from a bottle I had.I'm 110% sure that Dumbledore wouldn't be okay with you having a damn coffin. Vampires are considered bad beings in the wizzarding world so I'm guessing that like with Lupin (who is the fucking bomb) you would be treated as if you were a regular witch. That means sleeping on a bed.My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant MCR t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.My friend, Willow (AN: Raven dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Marilyn Manson t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)I would like to say that neither MCR or Marilyn Manson would exist in the Wizarding world. They're Muggles.""OMFG, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!"" she said excitedly.OMFG I like totes saw you tlking to that hottie DracoPlease tell me this text talk won't be a regular thing""Yeah? So?"" I said, blushing.""Do you like Draco?"" she asked as we went out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall.Of course you're a Slytherine""No I so fucking don't!"" I shouted.I'm calling BS""Yeah right!"" she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.""Hi."" he said.""Hi."" I replied flirtily.Why are you flirting??""Guess what."" he said.""What?"" I asked.""Well, Good Charlotte are having a concert in Hogsmeade."" he told me.Good Charlotte is a Muggle band... you don't care? Nevermind then""Oh. My. Fucking. God!"" I screamed. I love GC.

Oh God no.We started frenching passively So neither of you are reacting. and we took off each others clothes enthusiastically. He felt me up before I took of my top.

Then he flew away angrily on his broomstick.I was so scared and mad I didn't know what to do. Suddenly Draco came into the woods.""Draco!"" I said. ""Hi!""""Hi."" he said back but his face was all sad. He was wearing white foundation and messy eyeliner kind of like a pentagram (geddit) (F*ck you) between Joel Madden and Gerard Way.""Are you okay?"" I asked.""No."" he answered.""I'm sorry I got all mad at you but I thought you cheated on me."" I expelled. (Really?)""That's okay."" he said all depressed and we went back into Hogwarts together making out. (How would they do that?)Sins Tally: 176No fanfic is without sin."
