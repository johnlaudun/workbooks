Nah I ain't scared to go over there. I don't think it's none to be scared of. But, but it's still strange to hear. I think them old people say that spirit will not let you dig to get to the gold, whatever's down there. That's what them old people used to say. It's not going let ya. And it's kinda strange they clean all that. They clean all the distance, but they never clean that spot there.
